- R is the actual programming language that performs the commands
- RStudio is an IDE (Integrated development environment) or GUI that helps you write and organize code
- R is necessary to use RStudio, but R is more complex and confusing without RStudio

```{r}
5 + 10
```

Use the assignment operator to create named variables or objects

```{r}
x <- 3 * 2

# Running code

Functions take in objects, perform some set of operations, and return another object
```{r, eval = FALSE}
function_name(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2, ...)
```

--
Like the sequence function, which creates a vector of numbers
```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 20, length.out = x)
```

# Import data with `readr`

See script: 03-loading-data.R

---
# Import data

**Remember to load the tidyverse**
```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Import the raw data with `read_csv()`
```{r eval = FALSE}
letters <- read_csv("data-raw/dvdm-correspondence-1591.csv")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
letters <- read_csv("../data-raw/dvdm-correspondence-1591.csv")
```

---
# Inspect the data

Letters sent to Daniel van der Meulen from 1578 to 1592.

```{r}
letters
```

---
# Parse the date variable

```{r, eval = FALSE}
letters <- read_csv("data-raw/dvdm-correspondence-1591.csv",
                    col_types = 
                      cols(date = col_date(format = "%Y%m%d")))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
letters <- read_csv("../data-raw/dvdm-correspondence-1591.csv",
                    col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%Y%m%d")))
```

---
# Saving the data

The converse of `read_csv()` is `write_csv()`.

Write the data frame to the "data" folder with the date variable parsed correctly.
```{r eval = FALSE}
write_csv(letters, "data/dvdm-correspondence.csv")
```

- "data/" places the file in the data folder.
- "dvdm-correspondence.csv" names the file. Make sure to put the csv extension on the end.

**Tip**: Minimize the objects that you save. The code that created the objects is more important.

# Explore data with `dplyr`
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr.png")
```

See script: 04-explore-data.R

---
# Explore data with `dplyr`

## Six main verbs

- select: pick variables or columns to keep or discard

- arrange: reorder rows by values in columns

- filter: pick observations or rows by their values

- mutate: create new variables from information from existing variables

- summarise: Collapse observations to a summary value such as count, mean, or median

- group: Group the observations in order to make a summary of them

---
## `select()`

Pick variables or columns to keep or discard
```{r eval = FALSE}
select(letters, writer, date)
```

--
Get rid of variables you do not want to keep
```{r eval = FALSE}
select(letters, -writer, - date)
```

--
Rearrange columns
```{r eval = FALSE}
select(letters, writer, date, destination, source)
```

--
Rename columns within selection: `new_name = old_name`
```{r eval = FALSE}
select(letters, writer, from = source, to = destination)
```

--
To keep all variables but rename one or more use `rename()`
```{r eval = FALSE}
rename(letters, correspondent = writer)
```

---
# `arrange()`

`arrange()` does not change the data. It only alters the presentation of the data.

Arrange rows by values in a variable
```{r eval = FALSE}
arrange(letters, writer)
```

--
Arrange rows by multiple variables
```{r eval = FALSE}
arrange(letters, source, destination)
```

--
Arrange rows in descending order with `desc()`
```{r eval = FALSE}
arrange(letters, desc(date))
```

---
# `filter()`

## Comparison in R: what to keep vs what to discard

- Greater than and less than: `>, >=, <, <=`

- Equal and not equal: `==` and `!=`
    - *note the two equal signs to show equality*

- And, or, not: `&, |, !`

---
# `filter()`

Pick letters sent to Antwerp
```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(letters, destination == "Antwerp")
```

--
Why doesn't this work?
```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(letters, destination == Antwerp)
```

--
Pick letters sent during certain years
```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(letters, year >= 1584 & year <= 1586)
```

--
Remove rows that do not have a known source or destination: `NA`
```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(letters, !is.na(source), !is.na(destination))
```

---
# `mutate()`

Create new variables from information from existing variables
```{r eval = FALSE}
mutate(data, variable_name = function_call)
```

--
Create new variable with dates from Julain calendar for letters sent after 1582.
```{r}
# New data frame with letters after 1582
gregorian_letters <- filter(letters, year > 1582)
```

--
Subtract 10 days from date column of new data frame
```{r eval = FALSE}
# New variable with Julian calendar dates
mutate(gregorian_letters, julian = date - 10)
```

---
# `summarise()`

English spelling comes from Hadley Wickham's birthplace of New Zealand üá≥üáø

You can also use `summarize()` if you prefer the zed üòâ

--
`summarise()` has a similar formula to `mutate()`
```{r eval = FALSE}
mutate(data, variable_name = function_call)
```

--
Let's try it with `n()` to count the observations
```{r}
summarise(letters, count = n())
```

ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑

---
## `summarise()` with `group_by()`
Summarise is not very useful without `group_by()`.

--

Group the data frame by a variable and then use `summarise()` and `n()`
```{r}
# create grouped data frame
letters_writer <- group_by(letters, writer)
```

How many letters were written by each correspondent?
```{r eval = FALSE}
summarise(letters_writer, count = n())
```

# What if you want to perform multiple operations?

How many letters were sent from each location while Daniel lived in Bremen?

--
```{r}
# letters to Bremen
letters_bremen <- filter(letters, destination == "Bremen")

# group data frame by source
bremen_grouped <- group_by(letters_bremen, source)

# number of letters per source
bremen_summarised <- summarise(bremen_grouped, count = n())

# arrange with most at top
finally_done <- arrange(bremen_summarised, desc(count)) 
```

3. Each value must have its own cell.

# What is problematic about this data?

```{r eval = FALSE}
read_csv("/data-raw/barley.csv")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
read_csv("../data-raw/barley.csv")
```

# Dealing with `NA`

### What character is being used instead of `NA`?

```{r eval = FALSE}
read_csv("data-raw/barley.csv", na = "-")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
barley <- read_csv("../data-raw/barley.csv", na = "-")
barley

# Gather a data frame

```{r eval = FALSE}
gather(data, key = "key", value = "value", variables_to_gather)
```

**key:** the name for the variable whose values are currently variable names.

**value:** the name of the variable whose values are contained within the columns that are to be gathered.

# Gather barley data frame

```{r echo = FALSE}
barley_long <- gather(barley, key = month, value = price, -Year)
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
gather(barley,
       key = month,
       value = price,
       -Year)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
gather(barley,
       key = month,
       value = price,
       September:August)
```
]

# Now what do we need to do?

--

1. Create a full date with day, month, and year

--

2. Unite the day, month, and year, data into a single variable

--

3. Make the variable a date class

--

4. Label the type of grain

--

To help with number 3, we can use the **lubridate** package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("lubridate")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(lubridate)
```

---
## 1. Create a full date with day, month, and year

--

```{r}
barley_long %>% 
  mutate(day = 1) #<<
```

---
## 2. Unite the day, month, and year, data into a single variable

--

```{r}
barley_long %>% 
  mutate(day = 1) %>% 
  unite(col = date, "Year", "month", "day", sep = " ") #<<
```

---
## 3. Make the variable a date class with lubridate

--

```{r}
barley_long %>% 
  mutate(day = 1) %>% 
  unite(col = date, "Year", "month", "day", sep = " ") %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) #<<
```

---
## 4. Label the type of grain

--

```{r echo = FALSE}
barley_tidied <- barley_long %>% 
  mutate(day = 1) %>% 
  unite(col = date, "Year", "month", "day", sep = " ") %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>% 
  mutate(grain = "barley")
```


```{r}
barley_long %>% 
  mutate(day = 1) %>% 
  unite(col = date, "Year", "month", "day", sep = " ") %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>% 
  mutate(grain = "barley") #<<
```

---
# Repeat with oats and wheat data

Repeat steps with "oats.csv" and "wheat.csv" to create `barley_tidied`, `oats_tidied`, and `wheat_tidied`.

Make sure to label the grain the correct type of grain.

--

```{r}
oats_tidied <- read_csv("../data-raw/oats.csv", na = "-") %>% 
  gather(key = month, value = price, -Year) %>% 
  mutate(day = 1) %>% 
  unite(col = date, "Year", "month", "day", sep = " ") %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(date),
         grain = "oats")

wheat_tidied <- read_csv("../data-raw/wheat.csv", na = "-") %>% 
  gather(key = month, value = price, -Year) %>% 
  mutate(day = 1) %>% 
  unite(col = date, "Year", "month", "day", sep = " ") %>% 
  mutate(date = ymd(date),
         grain = "wheat")
```

---
# Bind barley, oats, and wheat data

Bind the rows of the three data frames with `bind_rows()` to create a `grain_prices` data frame.

bind_rows(barley_tidied, oats_tidied, wheat_tidied)

```{r}
bind_rows(barley_tidied, oats_tidied, wheat_tidied)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
grain_prices <- bind_rows(barley_tidied, oats_tidied, wheat_tidied)
```


---
# Visualize the data

```{r out.height = 400}
ggplot(data = grain_prices, aes(x = date, y = price, color = grain)) + 
  geom_line()
```
